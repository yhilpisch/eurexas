## Python code and IPython Notebooks

In this repository, you find all accompanying **Python codes** (modules/scripts) as well as **IPython Notebooks** of the above two tutorials.

Using the **IPython Notebook environment** (cf. http://ipython.org) you are able to reproduce all results (data, results, graphics) of the tutorials.

## Python Prerequisites

If you do not have already installed a current Python interpreter (2.7.x) with the most important data analytics libries (mainly NumPy, pandas, PyTables/HDF5, matplotlib are needed), it is easiest to install the **Anaconda Python distribution** which is free and available for all main operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS). You can download it under http://continuum.io/downloads.

## Help and Support
